##Laravel Subscribe##

This si my first foray into Laravel, a simple user authentication system that utilizes the Stripe Billing API that's built into Laravel to add subscriptions to user accounts.  Users can create accounts with or without signing up for Billing.

The app also features the ability to create Admin accounts, which have access to account editing and deletion.
